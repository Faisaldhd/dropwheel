# Function matrix

PASS/FAIL evidence for the 2.4.0 tools. Append one section per tool; do not rewrite another tool's
rows. A PASS names the assertion that produced it. `(inspection)` means the behaviour was verified by
reading the shipped code in this environment because a desktop session was not available; every other
row is an automated test that runs in CI.

## Collage — `tools.collage`

| ID | Check | Expected / assertion | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C-1 | Output 1080 × 1080 | `Collage.png` next to the first input; `rendered.Width == 1080`, `rendered.Height == 1080` | PASS | `CollageTests.Renderer_honours_every_output_preset_and_leaves_the_source_files_untouched(1080,1080)` |
| C-2 | Output 1920 × 1080 | Same file, `rendered.Width == 1920`, `rendered.Height == 1080` | PASS | same theory, `(1920,1080)` |
| C-3 | Output 1080 × 1920 | Same file, `rendered.Width == 1080`, `rendered.Height == 1920` | PASS | same theory, `(1080,1920)` |
| C-4 | Original resolution, not preview | 400×300 and 300×400 sources produce the exact 1080/1920 output sizes above; the 640 px preview never caps the write | PASS | same theory (source sizes are hard-coded in the test) |
| C-5 | Grid cell layout | 320×240, spacing 40, radius 0: pixel (70,120) is image 1, (160,120) is the background gap, (250,120) is image 2; (70,5) and (315,120) stay inside their cells | PASS | `CollageTests.Renderer_places_the_images_in_the_grid_cells_with_the_background_in_the_gap` |
| C-6 | Source files untouched | SHA-256 and `LastWriteTimeUtc` identical before and after Apply for both inputs | PASS | same preset theory, hash and timestamp assertions |
| C-7 | Never overwrite | First Apply writes `Collage.png`; second writes `Collage (2).png` and the first file still exists | PASS | `CollageTests.Renderer_writes_the_output_next_to_the_first_file_and_never_overwrites` |
| C-8 | Primary button label | `CollageTool.PrimaryLabelKey == "tool.collage.create"`; English table = `Create Collage`; Arabic value differs and the key exists in both tables | PASS | `CollageTests.Primary_label_is_create_collage_in_both_tables` |
| C-9 | Window ~560 × 745 adaptive | `ToolWindowSizer` with the 1920×1080 probe gives 560 × 747.5 at 100%; 1366×768 clamps inside 95% × 90% of the work area | PASS | `CollageTests.Window_probe_keeps_the_designed_size_and_fits_a_small_work_area` |
| C-10 | Theme dark/light | Every surface uses `Theme.Card`/`Text`/`Muted`/`Track`/`Accent`/`AccentGradient`/`PanelBorder`; the Reset background follows `Theme.IsDark`; the shared palette switches between dark `#232131` and light `#FFFFFF` cards without error | PASS (inspection + palette test) | `CollageView` uses `Theme.*`; `CollageTests.Theme_switches_between_dark_and_light_palettes_for_the_tool` |
| C-11 | RTL | Window inherits `FlowDirection.RightToLeft`; label/control rows mirror; filmstrip is deliberately LTR (photo sequence is content order); no hard-coded English except numeric preset labels (`1080 × 1080`) and the `×` symbol | PASS (inspection) | `ToolWindow` FlowDirection + `CollageView` layout; screenshots not available in this agent (desktop session) |

**How to reproduce the automated rows:** `dotnet test tests/FileAction.Tests/FileAction.Tests.csproj -c Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CollageTests"` (38 cases) or the CI `Build + test` job.
